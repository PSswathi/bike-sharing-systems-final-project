# bike-sharing-systems-final-project
The goal of the bike-sharing system problem is to predict the demand for bikes at various times by analyzing key factors such as time of day, weather conditions, season, and other relevant variables. Accurate demand forecasting enables strategic decision-making for optimizing bike-sharing networks, such as expanding coverage areas, optimizing bike availability, and adjusting pricing models. For instance, predictions of higher demand during certain times, weather conditions, or seasons can help operators enhance their services, allocate resources more efficiently, and create dynamic pricing strategies to meet user needs effectively. Additionally, understanding demand patterns can support infrastructure planning and improve customer satisfaction by ensuring bikes are available when and where they are needed the most.
